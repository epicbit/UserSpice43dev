Build 28-

SQL:
Added 'title' column to 'pages' table, updated insert sql with default titles


Updates:
users/admin_menu.php- adjusted logic; added check for a valid menu_title and
    redirect with an error message; removed 'action' from item edit href

users/admin_menu_item.php- adjusted logic; added check for a valid menu_title
    and redirect with an error message; since 'edit' is the only action and
    the only thing we do with the page, there is no reason to check for an
    action and redirect when the action is not 'edit', so logic adjusted
    accordingly

users/includes/header.php- added check for page title and echo accordingly

users/admin_page.php- added input for page title and $_POST code to update db

helpers/us_helpers.php- updated fetchPageDetails() to grab page title

helpers/language.php- added line for page title renaming
